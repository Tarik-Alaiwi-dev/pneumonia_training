## Workflow

1. **Research & Literature Review**
   - Investigated state-of-the-art approaches in medical imaging, including:
     - [ViTs for diseases classification (with self-supervised pre-training)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05573)
     - [Lung segmentation and disease classification pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304013/)
     - [Explainability via Grad-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391)

2. **Data & Preprocessing**
   - Curated a decent-quality dataset of chest X-rays [(RSNA Challenge)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data)
   - Applied augmentations (CLAHE, rotations, flips etc.) and normalization for robustness

3. **Model Development**
   - Selected a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) as the backbone
   - Fine-tuned using transfer learning with medical imaging data
   - Incorporated ideas from literature (e.g., augmentations for inbalanced dataset)

4. **Explainability (XAI)**
   - Integrated Grad-CAM to visualize model attention
   - Heat map highlighting lung regions indicative of the disease

5. **Demo & Deployment**
   - Built and deployed a Gradio demo for real-time predictions
